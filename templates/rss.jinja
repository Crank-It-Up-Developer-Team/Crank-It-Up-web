<p>Using RSS on CrankItUp's MapWorld is quite easy, it boils down to just two simple steps:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Go to any of the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Any mapper page</li>
            <li>The home page</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Add /feed to the end of the URL, and put that in your RSS reader!</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you've done that, you should be able to see all of that content in your feed, cool right?</p>
<h3>Example:</h3>
<p>The feed for an mapper named MrMoor2007 would look like this: <a
        href="https://mapworld.annoyingrains.xyz/mappers/MrMoor2007/feed">https://mapworld.annoyingrains.xyz/mappers/MrMoor2007/feed</a>
</p>
